# Heart Attack Risk Prediction Dataset Analysis

## Project Goal Clarification
The objective of this project was to analyze the Heart Attack Risk Prediction dataset to gain insights into various factors influencing heart attacks and to test multiple statistical methods. This analysis was performed using Python and Excel.

## About the Dataset
- **Age**: Age of the patient.
- **Sex**: Sex of the patient.
- **exang**: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no).
- **ca**: Number of major vessels (0-3).
- **cp**: Chest pain type:
  - Value 1: Typical angina.
  - Value 2: Atypical angina.
  - Value 3: Non-anginal pain.
  - Value 4: Asymptomatic.
- **trtbps**: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg).
- **chol**: Cholesterol in mg/dL fetched via BMI sensor.
- **fbs**: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dL (1 = true; 0 = false).
- **rest_ecg**: Resting electrocardiographic results:
  - Value 0: Normal.
  - Value 1: Having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV).
  - Value 2: Showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria.
- **thalach**: Maximum heart rate achieved.
- **target**: 0 = Less chance of heart attack, 1 = More chance of heart attack.

## Key Insights and Results Summary
1. **Descriptive Analysis**:
   - The average age of patients is 54.37 years.
   - Cholesterol levels have a mean of 250.13 mg/dL, with significant variation across patients.
   - Most patients do not experience exercise-induced angina, as indicated by the mean value of 0.684 for `exang`.

2. **Inferential Analysis**:
   - Statistically significant differences were observed in cholesterol levels across chest pain types (ANOVA results).
   - Attributes like age, blood pressure, and cholesterol show weak correlation with the target variable.

3. **Regression Analysis**:
   - The regression model had an R-squared value of 0.0457, indicating a weak relationship between predictors and heart attack risk.

4. **Chi-Square Test**:
   - Significant differences were observed between observed and expected frequencies for chest pain type and exercise-induced angina, suggesting these factors are crucial in determining heart attack risk.

## Challenges Faced and Solutions
1. **Challenge**: Finding a suitable dataset that fit the requirements of applying multiple statistical methods.
   - **Solution**: Searched for datasets on platforms like Kaggle and GitHub, and selected one meeting the project criteria.

2. **Challenge**: Understanding the dataset and identifying problems suitable for various statistical analyses.
   - **Solution**: Applied descriptive methods to summarize and comprehend the dataset before diving into more complex analyses.

## Tools and Techniques Used
- **Python**: Libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and SciPy for statistical methods.
- **Excel**: To verify and cross-check Python results.
- **Statistical Methods**: 
  - Descriptive Statistics (Mean, Median, Standard Deviation, etc.).
  - Inferential Statistics (t-test, z-test).
  - Correlation and Regression Analysis.
  - Logistic Regression.
  - ANOVA (Single-factor).
  - Chi-Square Test.

## Differences Between Python and Excel Results
- Some minor discrepancies were observed between the results generated by Python and Excel, likely due to differences in computational precision and methods.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of various statistical analyses to understand and predict heart attack risks, providing actionable insights into key health factors. The use of both Python and Excel allowed for a robust verification of results and methodologies.
