# Heart Attack Risk Prediction Dataset Analysis

## Project Goal Clarification
The objective of this project was to analyze the Heart Attack Risk Prediction dataset to gain insights into various factors influencing heart attacks and to test multiple statistical methods. This analysis was performed using Python and Excel.

## About the Dataset
- **Age**: Age of the patient.
- **Sex**: Sex of the patient.
- **exang**: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no).
- **ca**: Number of major vessels (0-3).
- **cp**: Chest pain type:
  - Value 1: Typical angina.
  - Value 2: Atypical angina.
  - Value 3: Non-anginal pain.
  - Value 4: Asymptomatic.
- **trtbps**: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg).
- **chol**: Cholesterol in mg/dL fetched via BMI sensor.
- **fbs**: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dL (1 = true; 0 = false).
- **rest_ecg**: Resting electrocardiographic results:
  - Value 0: Normal.
  - Value 1: Having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV).
  - Value 2: Showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria.
- **thalach**: Maximum heart rate achieved.
- **target**: 0 = Less chance of heart attack, 1 = More chance of heart attack.

## **Key Insights and Results Summary**

### **Descriptive Analysis**
1. The **average age** of patients is **54.37 years**, with the majority (42.57%) falling in the age range of 50–60 years. 
2. The **average cholesterol level** is **246.26 mg/dL**, significantly higher than the known population mean of 200 mg/dL. 
3. There is **no significant difference** in the average maximum heart rate achieved between males (148.96 bpm) and females (151.13 bpm).

### **Inferential Analysis**
1. **ANOVA Results:**  
   - There are **no significant differences** in cholesterol levels across chest pain types (\( p = 0.6037 \)) or due to fasting blood sugar (\( p = 0.625 \)). *(Excel result – ANOVA results were clearer)*  

2. **Chi-Square Tests:**  
   - A **significant association** exists between exercise-induced angina (`exang`) and heart attack likelihood (\( p < 0.001 \)). *(Python result – independence chi-square test for rigor)*  
   - The distribution of chest pain types in the dataset significantly differs from the expected distribution (\( p < 0.001 \)). *(Excel result – goodness-of-fit chi-square test provided relevant details)*  

---

### **Regression Analysis**
1. **Simple Linear Regression (Age vs. Cholesterol):**  
   - A **positive but weak relationship** exists between age and cholesterol levels, with \( R^2 = 0.046 \), meaning age explains only 4.6% of the variance in cholesterol. *(Python result – regression details were consistent and detailed)*  

2. **Multiple Linear Regression (Age, Resting BP, Cholesterol):**  
   - Age and resting blood pressure have a weak but statistically significant relationship with heart attack likelihood (\( R^2 = 0.050 \), \( p = 0.000453 \)). *(Python result – clear and reliable outputs)*  

3. **Logistic Regression:**  
   - Chest pain type is the most significant predictor of heart attack risk, followed by sex and age. The model has an **AUC of 0.822**, indicating good predictive power. *(Excel result – provided AUC for a better evaluation of the model’s performance)*

## Challenges Faced and Solutions
1. **Challenge**: Finding a suitable dataset that fit the requirements of applying multiple statistical methods.
   - **Solution**: Searched for datasets on platforms like Kaggle and GitHub, and selected one meeting the project criteria.

2. **Challenge**: Understanding the dataset and identifying problems suitable for various statistical analyses.
   - **Solution**: Applied descriptive methods to summarize and comprehend the dataset before diving into more complex analyses.

## Tools and Techniques Used
- **Python**: Libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and SciPy for statistical methods.
- **Excel**: To verify and cross-check Python results.
- **Statistical Methods**: 
  - Descriptive Statistics (Mean, Median, Standard Deviation, etc.).
  - Inferential Statistics (t-test, z-test).
  - Correlation and Regression Analysis.
  - Logistic Regression.
  - ANOVA (Single-factor).
  - Chi-Square Test.

## Differences Between Python and Excel Results
- Some minor discrepancies were observed between the results generated by Python and Excel, likely due to differences in computational precision and methods.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of various statistical analyses to understand and predict heart attack risks, providing actionable insights into key health factors. The use of both Python and Excel allowed for a robust verification of results and methodologies.
